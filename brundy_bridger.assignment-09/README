TO RUN:
make
./assignment09

Customization notes:
some times there will be free floors (no monsters :D yay not a bug)
if monsters dont update they may be stone try moving to new level

dungeon conforming to the project specifications:
There are now both objects and monsters that move again! 

I have an issue with my expunge it causes a seg fault. I have tried running gdb on it and cant find the issue. I think that there may be a double free happening but then it happens right after the expunge. I spent wedesnday trying to fix and I just try and set it to a null pointer. But I think it is close.
