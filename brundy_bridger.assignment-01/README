- A minimum of 6 rooms, with sizes at least 4x3.
- Rooms are separated by at least one cell of non-room space.
- Immutable rock borders surrounding the dungeon.
- At least one up and one down staircase, ensuring all floors are connected.
- A fully connected dungeon all rooms are accessable
- Each room can contain at most one staircase unless additional stairs are required
- The starting room always contains a staircase back up adjacent to the player
- There is a cap on number of hallway tiles, number of hallway tiles in a row, number of hallway tiles in a single area becasue I think it makes the dungeon look better
